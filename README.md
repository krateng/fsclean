# fsclean

Clean unicode filenames in a directory tree. This is meant for your personal folder or a medialibrary - don't clean system directories or similar!

## Install

```sh
	pip install fsclean
```

## How to use

Use the command `fsclean <rootpath>`, e.g. `fsclean .`.

Use `--dryrun` to check what would be renamed.

Existing files will not be overwritten.
